Various projects and endeavors from rainbowsandpwnies

**firemaster\_linux\_port** : a linux port that works with current versions of firefox (3.6 tested) in linux (original firemaster can be found here: http://www.securityxploded.com/firemaster.php ). Firemaster is an application to brute-force the "master" password used to keep stored-passwords safe, and then obtain those stored passwords.

**cold\_fuzz** : a very simple network fuzzer for linux with a GUI in GTK

**dictsort** : a very simple c app which creates a markov model from a password dictionary file, and then uses that model to sort the dictionary.

**rainbow\_tables and pwnbles** : rainbow\_tables is some sloppy C code which implements a faster method of creating perfect rainbow tables, and pwnbles is the incomplete-without-a-deadline cleaner code successor.

**license** : All code is GNU/GPL3.
